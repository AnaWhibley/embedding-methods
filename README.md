It's possible that using a web component created with one version of React in a different version of React could cause compatibility issues. React is known for making occasional breaking changes between major versions, which can lead to compatibility issues when using components created with different versions of React.

However, web components are designed to be platform-independent, which means that they should be able to run in any environment that supports web components, regardless of the underlying framework or library. In theory, this means that a React-based web component should be usable in any environment that supports web components, regardless of the version of React that the environment is using.

That being said, if you are planning to use your web component in a React application with a different version of React, it would be a good idea to test it thoroughly to make sure that it works as expected. You may need to make some changes to your web component code to ensure compatibility with the different version of React that you are using.
