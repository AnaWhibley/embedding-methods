How to build the web component as a standalone .js file and use it in other projects without publishing it. To achieve this, you can follow these steps:

1. In the next.js application, create a separate directory called `components-dist` (or any name of your choice) under the root directory. This directory will contain the built web component files.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react react-dom react-web-component
```

3. Create a new file called `webpack.config.js` under the root directory of your next.js application. Add the following code to this file:

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/components/form.tsx",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "components-dist"),
    filename: "form.js",
    libraryTarget: "umd",
    library: "formComponent",
    umdNamedDefine: true,
    globalObject: "this",
  },
  devtool: "source-map",
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".jsx"],
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            presets: [
              "@babel/preset-env",
              "@babel/preset-react",
              "@babel/preset-typescript",
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
      filename: "index.html",
      inject: false,
    }),
  ],
};
```

4. Create an `index.html` file under the `src` directory with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Form Component</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./form.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

5. Add the following script to the `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
},
```

6. Run the build command to create the web component file:

```
npm run build
```

7. The built web component file will be available under the `components-dist` directory. You can use this file in other projects by importing it like any other script file:

```html
<script src="path/to/form.js"></script>
```

Once you've imported the script file, you can use the web component like any other custom element in your HTML:

```html
<form-component></form-component>
```

Make sure to include the script file before using the web component in your HTML.
