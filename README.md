Web Components can provide a way to encapsulate the form functionality and easily style and interact with the content. It can also take props to autopopulate the fields based on information from parent applications. Additionally, Web Components are designed to be standalone and don't require any additional dependencies to be installed in the parent applications.
With JS Embed Code, it may be difficult to encapsulate the form functionality and hide the implementation details of the form from parent applications. It may also be difficult to pass props to autopopulate the fields. Additionally, there is a risk of conflicts with the parent website's code versions and packages they use.
Using an API can allow parent applications to easily retrieve the form data and integrate it into their applications. It can also take props to autopopulate the fields based on information from parent applications. However, it may require additional server-side code to be written to handle the API requests.
SSI is a server-side technology and is not designed for embedding web applications. It may not be easy to encapsulate the form functionality and pass props to autopopulate the fields based on information from parent applications. Additionally, it may require server-side code changes to implement SSI.
Iframe can provide a way to embed the form in a parent application, but it does not meet the requirements of easily passing props to autopopulate the fields or being able to encapsulate the form functionality. Additionally, there may be conflicts with the parent website's code versions and packages they use.
