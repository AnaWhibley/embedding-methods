Web Components allow you to create reusable custom elements that can be easily embedded into other applications. They encapsulate their own functionality and styling, which makes it easy to hide their implementation details and avoid conflicts with the parent website's code and packages.

Additionally, Web Components can be easily customized using CSS variables, which allows the parent applications to easily style them according to their needs. They also provide a simple API for passing props and events between the parent and child components, which will allow you to autopopulate the fields based on information provided by the parent applications.

One of the biggest advantages of Web Components is that they can be used without any additional dependencies in the parent projects. They are also compatible with most modern browsers and do not require any special build tools, which makes it easy to install and use them in other projects.

To implement this approach, you can create a simple React application that contains your form, and then convert it into a Web Component using a library like LitElement or Polymer. Once you have created your Web Component, you can then easily embed it into other React applications by simply importing the component and adding it to your HTML code.

Here's an example of how you can create a Web Component using LitElement:
```
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';

class MyForm extends LitElement {
  static get properties() {
    return {
      field1: { type: String },
      field2: { type: String }
    };
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <form>
        <label for="field1">Field 1:</label>
        <input type="text" id="field1" name="field1" value="${this.field1}">
        <br>
        <label for="field2">Field 2:</label>
        <input type="text" id="field2" name="field2" value="${this.field2}">
      </form>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('my-form', MyForm);
```
To use this Web Component in another React application, you can simply import it and use it as follows:

```
import React from 'react';
import './MyForm.js';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Parent Application</h1>
      <my-form field1="Some value" field2="Another value"></my-form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This will render the MyForm component with the autopopulated field values provided as props from the parent application.

If your form is not in the same repository as your parent React application, you can still import it using a relative URL path, as long as it is hosted on a server that can serve static files over HTTP.

For example, if your form is hosted at https://example.com/myForm.js, you can import it in your parent React application like this:

```
import MyForm from 'https://example.com/myForm.js';
```

Note that this assumes that your form is exported as a JavaScript module, using the export default syntax. If it uses a different format, such as a Web Component or a custom element, you may need to use a different syntax to import it.

Web Components are a good option for embedding a component in a web page because they provide a way to encapsulate the component's styles, HTML, and behavior, making it easy to reuse the component across different projects and avoiding conflicts with other code on the page. Web Components can be used with any web framework, including React, and they can be easily integrated into existing web pages using HTML tags.

JS embed code, API, and SSI are also valid options for embedding content in a web page, depending on the specific use case. For example, JS embed code and API are often used to embed external content from third-party services, while SSI is a server-side technology that can be used to include snippets of HTML code in a web page. However, these options may not provide the same level of encapsulation and reusability as Web Components, and may require additional configuration and setup.

Yes, if you're using web components to create your embedded form, it's a good idea to use a build tool like webpack to bundle and optimize the code. Webpack can also handle things like transpiling your code to work across different browsers, which can be especially important when working with web components.

Using webpack can also make it easier to share your component with other developers or teams within your organization, as it provides a consistent and standardized way to package and distribute your code.

Overall, using webpack with web components can help ensure that your embedded form is performant, reliable, and easy to use across different projects and environments.

Webpack config:

```
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'my-component.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    library: 'MyComponent',
    libraryTarget: 'umd',
  },
  devtool: 'source-map',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
          },
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: 'public/index.html',
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: 'public', to: '' },
      ],
    }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'my-component.css',
    }),
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
    port: 8080,
    open: true,
  },
};
```

This configuration file will output a single my-component.js file in the dist directory that can be used as a web component. The library and libraryTarget options are used to configure the output as a web component that can be loaded with a script tag.

You can then include this web component in other projects by loading it with a script tag:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <my-component></my-component>
    <script src="path/to/my-component.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can pass props to the web component using the HTML attributes:

```
<my-component name="John" age="30"></my-component>
```

In the web component's JavaScript code, you can access the props with the getAttribute method:

```
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const name = this.getAttribute('name');
    const age = this.getAttribute('age');
    // Use name and age to render the component
  }
}
```
